He came in very simply, felt very authentic. Funny style tho, made me think of the sloth from zootopia. 

So swinging between the lab and the playground right ? And wow those ninths sound great and …well I’m not able recognize what this is ( it’s been 4 years since I’ve stopped doing theory ) and my mind is stuck to the note’s names, the atmospheres he managed to create were charming tho. There’s absolutely no structure to this, he came with a couple of concepts and just explored them with us. But he mastered this, it’s perfectly unprepared; he is actually in this “open mode”.

Process of making :

- Connect ideas to create meaning
- Evaluate
- Most of the time it’s non-sense
- It’s not a logical process, every steps doesn’t need to be right ( they shouldn’t be )
- But it’s not just that, you need to spend time in the lab

Don’t hesitate to capture moments and get back to them later\
Put yourself under pressure\
Let your unconscious work for you\
You can put a triton over a regular chord and only stick to this for several weeks, until you’ve explored enough. it’s not only playground.\
Break the whole thing so you will never be afraid of breaking the whole thing anymore\
Be innocent

I might talk about him once I finish reading “Récoltes et Semailles“  … well I don’t think I will finish it but my ideas are too vague, for the moment.

I’m definitely amazed.
